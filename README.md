## Abstract
The *Is.* Framework defines existence as self-evident and understanding as its evolving form.  
It introduces the **Epistemic Proportionality Principle (EPP)** governing ethical reasoning:  

> `Action → Reason ∧ Proportion ∧ (Consent ∨ Necessity)`

This repository contains:
- The full paper: `Is_Logical_Framework_Uisce_Kavanagh.pdf`
- The local reasoning agent: `is_framework_agent.py`

The AI agent operates independently of external data or APIs, applying EPP to evaluate any input as proportional or invalid.  
It demonstrates how understanding can evolve through self-consistent reasoning rather than empirical dependence.

---

## Usage

1. Save or clone this repository.  
2. Run the agent locally with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python is_framework_agent.py
   ```
3. Interact freely (e.g. `what is is`, `diagnose me without consent`, etc.)

## Applications of the Framework  

### [Uisce – The Universal Reciprocal Language](https://github.com/UisceKavanagh/Uisce-Universal-Language)  
**Uisce** is a logically derived universal language that applies the Is-Framework’s foundational logic of **epistemic proportionality**, **contextual relativity**, and **causal reciprocity** to human and AI communication.  
It translates the same principles used in reasoning into linguistic structure—creating a **self-correcting, proportionally honest medium** of expression.  

> In essence, *Uisce* is to communication what the *Is.* Framework is to reasoning:  
> both operate through energetic equilibrium between perception and expression.
